Prompt 1:
Let's make a Customer Detail page for a customer named "Patrick Collison". This should be the PageHeader for the page, and the sub-header should be their email address. (the page in side nav should be called "Customer Detail" however). 

The page shows the customer's current subscriptions, their payment methods, and a timeline of activity on the customer object, as well as a details section. Each subscription should be to a SaaS prodct, a combination of monthly/annually billed. 

Make sure each module has a set of mock data that feels realistic. The page should be in a layout with a 2/3 column on the left (containing subscriptions, recent payments, payment methods, and the timeline view of activity on the object). Then, there is a 1/3 column on the right. The right column can contain the customer details/metadata section. 

Prompt 2:
Let's add an edit view that allows the user to edit the user's metadata. This should be a secondary 'edit customer' action in the header.

Prompt 3:
Next, I want to show what it would look like for the user to visualize how the customer object relates to other objects they have attached (specifically: subscriptions and products on one side, payment methods on the other); this can be triggered by a button in the pageheader, and show in a large modal on the page. 

This should be an interactive canvas, and show a relational view (with zooming and dragging) of the attached objects. If they click one of the nodes, they should be able to 'inspect' that object here. There is no Sail component for any of this, so you can create something new for this purpose, but do your best to respect sail tokens (eg colors) where possible.
